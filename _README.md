### Installing Dependencies

The client files currently live together with the server files, so you'll have to do an install for both projects.
From root directory:

```sh
$ npm install
$ cd TreasureTrek
$ npm install
```
You could very easily move TreasureTrek to it's own repo to and develop both independently.
